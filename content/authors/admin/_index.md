I am a M.A.Sc student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia working under the supervision of Prof. ([Karthik Pattabiraman]([https://ce.uk.ac.ir/en/home](https://ece.ubc.ca/karthik-pattabiraman/))). I earned my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering At Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman. 

My research is mainly focused on designing robust and reliable Machine Learning models, as well as accurate fault injection tools for these models. I've collaborated with Reconfigurable Computing Lab, Simon Fraser University and Computer Aided Design Lab, Chinese University of Hong Kong. I have published two papers on top-tier conferences such a DATE2022, and DSD2022.

In 2018, I won the bronze medal of [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) Asia Tehran Regional competition which is an algorithmic programming contest for university students. My team got the 4th place in the onsite (main) contest and first place at online contest. In 2020, I won the [CAD Contest](http://iccad-contest.org/2020/index.html), a multi-month research and development competition, focusing on advanced, real-world problems in the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA). My group managed to get the first place of the problem C : *GPU Accelerated Logic Re-Simulation*.
